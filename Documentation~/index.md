# WebRTC 

WebRTC for Unity is a package that allows [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) to be used in Unity. 

First, please check [the requirements](requirements.md) to make sure that the platform you are expecting is supported.

To get started, please see the [Installation](install.md) and [Tutorial](tutorial.md) pages. The package also provides a number of samples. Check out [the samples page](sample.md) to learn how to use them. And moreover, [Unity Render Streaming](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.renderstreaming@latest) also uses this package to provide a higher layer of API.
