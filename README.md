# WebRTC for Unity: Optimized for Android X86_64 builds

This is a fork of [WebRTC for
Unity](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.webrtc) that is
attempting to enchance the Android X86_64 builds experience.

Use [WebRTC for
Unity](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.webrtc) unless you are
specifically targeting Android (API level 29 and above) X86_64 builds.
